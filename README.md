## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Movement
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Left Click**: Shoot
- **Space**: Jump
- **ESC**: Pause game

## Development

This project was created **entirely using the [Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) VS Code Extension**, which provides AI-assisted coding capabilities. No line of code was written manually - everything from game mechanics to audio synthesis was generated through conversation with the AI assistant.

### Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Web Audio API for sound synthesis
- HTML5 Canvas for UI elements
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [ThePrimeagen's Chat Codes video with Delvin AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW6PhVdq9R8), which demonstrated the potential of AI-assisted game development using Devin AI. Anime Doom takes this concept further by creating a complete game experience using similar AI-assisted techniques.
